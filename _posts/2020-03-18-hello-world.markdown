Hi there!

Due to a certain beverage-named pandemic keeping me indoors a lot these days, I decided to set up a personal website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
If I find that I have something enlightening to share with the world, I might post it on here. No promises though.

The rest of this post is really just about testing some stuff.
Apparently I can do code snippets?

{% highlight python %}
def can_do_snippets()
    print('Why, yes!')

# cool!
{% endhighlight %}

And math, too?

\\[\pi \approx 3 \\]

And even inline? \\(\implies \\) awesome!

Okay, that's it for this post.
